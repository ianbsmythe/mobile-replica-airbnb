# Airbnb Homepage Recreation - School of Code Onboarding Task

## Project Overview

This project is a recreation of Airbnb's mobile homepage using vanilla HTML and CSS. It was completed as part of an application and onboarding task, demonstrating skills in front-end web development and attention to detail in replicating a complex user interface.

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- Custom search bar with placeholder text and icons
- Horizontally scrollable category icons
- Property listings with images, titles, and availability information
- "Inspiration for future getaways" section with scrollable categories
- Footer sections including Support, Hosting, and Airbnb information

## Technical Details

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling techniques including:
  - Flexbox and Grid for layout
  - Custom fonts (Montserrat)
  - CSS variables for consistent theming
  - Responsive design without media queries
  - Custom scrollbars
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries used

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the page
- `style.css`: CSS file with all styles for the project
- `images/`: Directory containing all image assets used in the project

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
3. For the best experience, use the browser's device emulation tool to view the page in a mobile device format

## Future Improvements

- Implement functionality for the search bar and category filters
- Add more interactive elements such as favoriting listings
- Enhance accessibility features
- Optimize images for faster loading times
